								<h2>Who We Are</h2>
								<p>The Scythe project is made up of a small team of developers, web designers, hackers, doxxers, booters and more. While some of those categories of people may sound daunting, they all play their part and role. The Scythe project was originally founded in 2020 by Scythe (Matthew Bullet). Matt is a 19 year old (at the time of this sites creation) who lives in OakWood, United Kingdom. </p>

                                <br>
                                
								<h2>Our Goals</h2>
                                <p>Our main goal is to make the internet a fun and exciting place for all users. Yes, we know that sounds cringe but most sites and groups claim to want this but don't follow through with it. We wish (as a collective mass) to show that we mean business. All websites on the web have at most, either one or just a few genres when it comes to content.</p>
                                <p>We wish to host content for all categories available on all platforms, things such as games, applications and general media. As far as we know, this has never been done before and not only do we think it's possible, but doable. You may be wondering why we are hosting this site on GitHub, to answer in short terms, hosting services like GoDaddy or Wix may remove or take down our hard work. GitHub is a place to share stuff open sourced which makes it easier for us.</p>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                            	<p>As mentioned above, we want to create a place where content for all categories and platforms can be found. You may be wondering how we obtain some of this content. We have web scrapers and automatic algorithms that not only find but save content on our private servers. This content then gets reviewed by us (for user safety) and uploaded onto our site. As this is a self funded project, we only have our personal servers and hosting services like MediaFire, Mega and Google Drive to store content.</p>
                                <p>Eventually, space will run out and any donations from the public would really help us out! If you'd like to contribute towards our project, you can donate any given amount, small or large. We accept payment methods such as debit/credit cards, PayPal, CashApp, gift cards (Amazon, Google Play, Apple, etc) and all crypto currencies.</p>
